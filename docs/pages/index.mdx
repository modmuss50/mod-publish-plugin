### FAQ
- Why use Kotlin?
  - I wanted to explore using Kotlin for a larger project, as Gradle already includes Kotlin there should be little downside to the end user.
  - Gradle includes Kotlin so there is no additional dependency for the end user.
  - Groovy buildscripts are fully supported.
- Why do I need to specify the minecraft versions for both CurseForge and Modrinth?
  - Curseforge and Modrinth use different versioning for snapshots, thus they must be defined for each platform.
- Feature x or platform y is not supported
  - Please open an issue on this repo!
- I have a question and need some help
  - Please use the mod publish plugin discord channel on the [Team Reborn Discord](https://discord.gg/teamreborn)

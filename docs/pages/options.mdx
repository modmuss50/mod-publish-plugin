The mod publish plugin has a number of common options that are shared between all platforms.

```groovy
publishMods {
    // Set the main file to be uploaded
    file = jar.archiveFile

    // Markdown changelog
    changelog = "Example changelog"

    // Defaults to the Gradle project version
    version = "1.0.0"

    // Specify the release type
    type = STABLE
    type = BETA
    type = ALPHA

    // The display name/release title, this defaults to the Gradle project name + version
    displayName = "My Mod"

    // A list of mod loaders the release supports
    modLoaders.add("fabric")

    // A ConfigurableFileCollection of addional files that are uploaded alongside the main file
    additionalFiles.from(jar.archiveFile)

    // The max number of times to retry on server error, defaults to 3.
    maxRetries = 5

    // When dry run is enabled the release assets will be saved to the build directory for testing.
    dryRun = true
    // You can always enable it when one of your API keys is not present.
    dryRun = providers.environmentVariable("API_KEY").getOrNull() == null
}
```

Each platform inherits the above common options, and can all be individually configured. For example if you want to use a different file just for Github you could do the following:

```groovy
publishMods {
    // Default file
    file = jar.archiveFile

    github {
        // The githubJar is only used by the github publish task.
        file = githubJar.archiveFile
    }

    curseforge {
        // Default file used
    }

    modrinth {
        // Default file used
    }
}
```

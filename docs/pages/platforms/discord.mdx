## Basic example

![Discord example](/images/discord_example.png)

See the following minimal example showing how a message can be sent to a discord channel using a webhook.

```groovy
publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
        webhookUrl = providers.environmentVariable("DISCORD_WEBHOOK")
    }
}
```

Please note, when using the discord webhook you must also specify the `projectSlug` in any CurseForge publications. This is due to limitations in the CurseForge API.

By default discord will publish a message with the changelog to the supplied webhook. A link to all of the platforms will also be included.

```groovy
publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
        // Pass in the secret webhook URL. Required
        webhookUrl = providers.environmentVariable("DISCORD_WEBHOOK")

        // Pass in the secret webhook URL to post the messages when running a dry run. Optional
        dryRunWebhookUrl = providers.environmentVariable("DISCORD_WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN")

        // Set the username used to send the webhook, defaults to "Mod Publish Plugin"
        username = "My Cool Mod"

        // Set the avatar image url for the webhook, defaults to none.
        avatarUrl = "https://placekitten.com/500/500"

        // Set the content message, in this example a header is added before the changelog. Defaults to just the changelog
        content = changelog.map { "# A new version of my cool mod has been released! \n" + it}

        // If you wish to only link to certain platform you can do the following
        setPlatforms(publishMods.platforms.curseforge, publishMods.platforms.github)

        // Instead if you wish to link to all platform in a specific Gradle project you can do the following
        setPlatformsAllFrom(project(":child1"), project(":child2"))
    }
}
```

You can customise the platform specific message by using the `announcementTitle` property present on all of the platforms. This will be used as the title of the embed.

```groovy
publishMods {
    curseforge {
        announcementTitle = "Download from CurseForge"
    }
}
```

The webhook message can be customized to different styles  
The look can be set to `CLASSIC` or `MODERN`

<details>
  <summary>Look examples</summary>
  ## Classic look
  The classic look is used by default by the plugin

  ## Modern look
  ![Modern look](/images/discord_modern.png)

  ```groovy
  publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
      // ...
      style {
        // ...
        look = MODERN
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The style tag also has the options `thumbnailUrl` and `color`, this options allow you to customize more the look of your embeds

  The `color` option can be either an integer or a string, the string must be a full `RRGGBB` hex optionally prefixed with a `#`.  
  The string can also be `modrinth`, `github` or `curseforge`, with those working as alias for the colors used for the embed links for those platforms

  ![Example with thumbnail](/images/discord_modern_button_thumbnail.png)
  ```groovy
  publishMods {
    // ...
    discord {
      // ...
      style {
        // ...
        look = MODERN
        thumbnailUrl = https://example.com
        color = "github"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
